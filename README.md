## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**lochinthenature/lochinthenature** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ğŸ¤§I'm a beginner, learning in coding C++, and other languages in the future.
ğŸ˜´I can still touch grass even when I have to sit in front of the laptop screen about more than 4 hours continuously... TvT
